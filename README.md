# Expo SQLite Legacy Adapter

This library provides a wrapper around the newer React Native Expo SDK 51+ `expo-sqlite`, enabling it to behave like the older `expo-sqlite/legacy` module that was removed starting from SDK 52.

## Installation

```bash
npm install expo-sqlite-legacy-adapter
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createWebSQLWrapper } from 'expo-sqlite-legacy-adapter';
import * as ExpoSQLite from 'expo-sqlite';

const WebSQLWrapper = createWebSQLWrapper(ExpoSQLite);
const openDatabase = WebSQLWrapper.openDatabase;

// In your project, you can now use openDatabase as if nothing ever happened!
export default openDatabase;


// e.g. just do this
const db = openDatabase('my-database.db');

// Use the database as you would with the legacy API
db.transaction(tx => {
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, name TEXT);');
});
```

## Why Make This?

The rationale behind creating this library stems from the need to support legacy libraries that rely on WebSQL, which is no longer natively available on Expo/React-Native starting from Expo SDK 52. For instance, my previous patches to projects like [IndexedDBShim](https://github.com/indexeddbshim/IndexedDBShim/issues/313#issuecomment-590086778) to enable IndexedDB functionality on React Native would not work without WebSQL support. This adapter bridges that gap, ensuring compatibility and extending the usability of such libraries.

## Compatibility

- Requires Expo SDK 51 or higher.

I have included a tests.ts file with the package. You may try importing it from `expo-sqlite-legacy-adapter/tests`, and it can be run on Expo SDK 51 (with expo-sqlite installed) as follows.
```ts
import { runComparisonTests } from 'expo-sqlite-legacy-adapter/tests';

// Somewhere else
runComparisonTests()
```
Due to limited time, I must admit I relied on LLMs to help create the tests, but as far as I'm concerned it looks to be valid.

Results are as follows, which shows rather compliant behaviour with the original library. I've used this in a few side projects too which should help test its validity somewhat too.

As for the error codes, I cannot guarantee full 100% same behaviour. YMMV. Open to PRs.
